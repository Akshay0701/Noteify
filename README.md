# Noteify
## Noteify is a currency detection app made for the visually impaired to check whether they have been handed the right amount of money and thereby, ensuring that they have not been cheated upon, giving the output as a computer-generated audio, having basic UI for better UX. 

This is a project done by me and my partner <a href= "https://github.com/Ashniz24"> Ashna Nizam </a> and the app was developed using Flutter.

The main modules used are:

***camera*** <br>
***tflite*** <br>
***flutter_tts*** <br>
***path_provider***

The backend comprises of the tflite package using a tflite model along with the labels which specifies all the classes. The flutter_tts is a text-to-speech module in flutter used to convert text to speech, used here so that the output can be obtained as an audio.
